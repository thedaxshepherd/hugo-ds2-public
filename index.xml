            I would like to say that this blog has been relaunched on GitHub using Hugo. If something never launched in the first place I am not sure it can be relaunched. I initially had a WordPress blog on SiteGround. It never made it out of test. I learned a lot about deploying WordPress and the different plugins. It did come in handy when my work started using WordPress for the company site.
